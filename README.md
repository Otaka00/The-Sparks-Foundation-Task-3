## Exploratory Data Analysis (Retail)
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook written in Python 3 Language and an excel file that represents a dataset which contains profit and sales gained by certain regions and cities in the United States of America where the objective is to find weak areas that need more profit and show the business problems derived from graphs and visualizations of data. Hence, I used data analysis to clean the data and observe the statistical data then visualize it to determine which contains the highest or lowest profits.
